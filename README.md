# EFCore5Upgradation
we have FK & table naming convension mismatch issue so created this project to reproduce the issue. we have generated model snapshot using EFcore2.1. 
Now, we would like to upgrade to EFCore 5 with minimal changes to our database. So, we are trying to achieve this by referencing EFCore5 dependancies in the proj files. 
After referencing them, When we try to add-migration command EFCore5 analysing existing snapshot and creating new migration file with creating & dropping db objects. 

The FK and table names generated by EFCore5 are invalid. This is happening if we have inheritance between entities
